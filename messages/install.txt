How to use WordPress Completions

* Use "wp-" for view some completions
* Use "add_action-" for view actions completions
* Use "add_filter-" for view filters completions
* Use functions, constants or classes names, for e.g. plugin_dir... for view completions
* Use "name_of_class-method_name" for view method completions. e.g "WP_Error-add" by default all Classes wrap with sublime format completions
* Use "ctrl+space" or "alt+/" in linux for call completions if tag "<?php" not is defined. e.g. for create plugin header in empty file.
* On some cause the first "tab" deletes all parameters instead of having to tab through each one:
	- First Tab --> Select all parameters
	- Each Tab There after --> Selects each individual parameter or block
