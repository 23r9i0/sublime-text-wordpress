### Notes

Deprecated Functions, Constants, Classes, Methods and Hooks ( Actions or Filters ) or Themes have been removed

On some cause the first "tab" deletes all parameters instead of having to tab through each one:

- First Tab --> Select all parameters
- Each Tab There after --> Selects each individual parameter or block

Actions or Filter add two version of the completion only this not is dynamic name

Example of completion file for Hooks:
```
        {
            "trigger": "add_action-init\tWP Action",
            "contents": "add_action( 'init', ${1:\\$function_to_add}${2:, ${3:10}} );"
        },
        {
            "trigger": "init\tWP Action Name",
            "contents": "init"
        },
```
This first trigger use add_action- for get all actions and continue by name of the action, returns everything you need to create.
The second trigger simply use the name and return this name.

* Use `wp-` for view some completions
* Use `add_action-` for view actions completions
* Use `add_filter-` for view filters completions
* Use functions, constants or classes names, for e.g. plugin_dir... for view completions
* Use `name_of_class-method_name` for view method completions. e.g `WP_Error-add`
  by default all Classes wrap with sublime format completions
* Use `ctrl+space` or `alt+/` in linux for call completions if tag <?php not is defined. e.g. for create plugin header in empty file.


### Other Notes

Tested on Sublime Text 3118

If use Sublime Text before 3092 is possible what some snippet not working.

If your problem with `alt+/` to show completions popup in linux, set key bindings with `ctrl+space` by example

Default keys in linux:

```json
    ...
    { "keys": ["alt+/"], "command": "auto_complete" },
    { "keys": ["alt+/"], "command": "replace_completion_with_auto_complete", "context":
        [
            { "key": "last_command", "operator": "equal", "operand": "insert_best_completion" },
            { "key": "auto_complete_visible", "operator": "equal", "operand": false },
            { "key": "setting.tab_completion", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
        ]
    },
    ...
```
to:

```json
    ...
    { "keys": ["ctrl+space"], "command": "auto_complete" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+space"], "command": "replace_completion_with_auto_complete", "context":
        [
            { "key": "last_command", "operator": "equal", "operand": "insert_best_completion" },
            { "key": "auto_complete_visible", "operator": "equal", "operand": false },
            { "key": "setting.tab_completion", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
        ]
    },
    ...
```
